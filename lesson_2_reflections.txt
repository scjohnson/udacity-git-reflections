Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
do it?

It places a .git file in the directory to initialize the area so you
can make commits.

Q; How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a mark of items that will be included in the next
commit and provides a nice way for you to see what will be in your
commit before you do so.
