Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
do it?

It places a .git file in the directory to initialize the area so you
can make commits.

Q; How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a mark of items that will be included in the next
commit and provides a nice way for you to see what will be in your
commit before you do so.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?

By only adding to the staging area those changes in your current code
on disk that corresponds to a logical change.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?

For each of our releases we should make a branch so they can continue
to be supported while we continue new development. Also, for each DR
we fix, we could have a separate branch.

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help me see which commits are reachable by others so I can see
where specific features are implemented.

Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It combines the changes made in both branches into a single
commit. It's represented in the diagram to show it has parentage going
through both branches.
