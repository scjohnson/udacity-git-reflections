Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

To share with others and to have a remote backup.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To avoid pulling in changes from others when you aren't ready for them.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

A branch provides a way to work on different versions of the code and then
merge them together if and when needed. A clone brings a copy of a repository
to your local machine. A fork makes a copy of a github repository to another
github repository, while providing credit to the original author.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

To provide input as to whether it is appropriate to push.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
  and what would be harder?

I'd likely have to create my own git server somewhere. Or have it on my local
laptop for collaboration, which would make collaboration a bit more painful for
others to submit requests and for us to stay in sync.
